    "UMAP is a fairly flexible non-linear dimension reduction algorithm. It seeks to learn the manifold structure of your data and find a low dimensional embedding that preserves the essential topological structure of that manifold. In this notebook we will generate some visualisable 4-dimensional data, demonstrate how to use UMAP to provide a 2-dimensional representation of it, and then look at how various UMAP parameters can impact the resulting embedding. This notebook is based on the work of Philippe Rivi√®re for visionscarto.net."
