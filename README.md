# dimred

A [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) project for the application and evaluation of state-of-the-art neighbour-graph-type dimensionality reduction techniques on data generated by high-fidelity CFD simulations of turbulent and reacting flow.

## Background

The `dimred` project aims to create a way of visualizing high-dimensional CFD data. In turbulent reacting flow simulations, the large number of intrinsic variables (three spatial coordinates and velocity components, temperature, pressure, chemical species...) and derived variables (i.e. equivalence ratio) make understanding the data and their relationship complex. This complexity can be seen from images like the one presented below, extracted from a 3D LES simulation.

State-of-the-art neighbour-graph-type dimensionality reduction techniques allow to reduce the noise in the data in order to focus on the relevant relationships that drive the underlying physics.

## About

WIP

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for usage, development and testing purposes. **Please note** that only Linux environments are supported in the current implementation.

First clone this repository by:

```
git clone https://github.com/mrovirasacie/dimred
```

In order to use `dimred` several [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) packages are required. Creating a brand new [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) environment for this is recommended. This can be done easily with the provided `environment.yml` file as follows:

```
conda env create -f dimred/environment.yml
conda activate dimred
```

After executing these commands a new Conda environment named `dimred` will be created with all necessary packages. The environment is self-contained so as to not influence other local python installations and avoid conflicts with previously installed packages. To deactivate this environment simply type:

```
conda deactivate
```
